# SpareBite

SpareBite is a web-based food donation system developed by a group of students as part of a project.

The goal of this platform is to reduce food waste and help people in need by connecting those who have extra food with those who are looking for it. Donors can post details about the food they want to give away, and recipients can browse and request available donations.

The system includes three types of users: donors, recipients, and admins. Each user has their own dashboard with different features.

- Donors can add new donations and manage requests.
- Recipients can browse donations and request items.
- Admins can manage users, view reports, and update system settings.

SpareBite was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. The system is fully online, and all data is stored in a secure MySQL database.
